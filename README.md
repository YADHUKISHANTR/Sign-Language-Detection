# Sign-Language-Detection
A deep learning project built during an ICFOSS training program. The goal was to understand how neural networks work by designing and training a custom model using PyTorch.


# What I Worked On
- Dataset preparation and preprocessing<br>
- Designing a simple neural network architecture<br>
- Training and evaluating the model<br>
- Understanding loss functions and optimization<br>

# Tech Stack
Python, PyTorch

# Status
Completed as a learning project in 4th August 2025 to 23rd August 2025.
